TODO

Soon:
- Fix polling
- Make the docs accessible via the UI
- Update version number, make the version number dynamic in pyproject.toml, and add a version parameter to the module
- Test installing TurboCtl via pip
- Add TurboCtl to PyPI and conda-forge
- Update installation instructions

Later:
- Make sure only one user can control the pump at a time.
- Update test_ui
- Make sure all tests are ok and can be run automatically at once
- Make sure the program crashes elegantly when e.g. it cannot connect to the
  pump.
- Implement the results of tests with the real pump to the virtual pump.

Perhaps at some point:
- Improve the parser so that e.g. "list p [1, 2]" is valid syntax.
  The command parser could also be moved into a separate class, so that it
  could be tested more easily. Also, parser.py might be simplified by using
  the parsing modules in the standard library.
- Document the format in parameters.txt better? This might even be turned into
  e.g. a CSV file.
- Document individual enum members in codes.py.
- Rename WrongNumError to NumberError or something?
- Open the output of the info and help commands with less if a specific
  argument is given?
- Add commands to set the setpoint (most important), save data, read errors
  etc.
- Move singledispatchmethod to datatypes.py.
- Run pylint/pycodestyle.
- The docstrings of the read/write_parameter methods say
  "Raises ValueError if number or index have invalid values". Clarify this.
- Add a command to open the docs in a web browser.
- Add instructions for importing the API/control interface (and also add 
  those to the turboctl namespace)
- Make sure there are no TODO tags anywhere is the code.
- Fix the bug where closing TurboCtl in screen doesn't erase the UI text.
