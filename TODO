TODO

Changelog:
    - Moved docs to Read the Docs
    - Addded the -d command line argument

Soon:
- Add TurboCtl to Read the Docs:
    - Remove built html docs from git
    - Version bump & changelog
    - Upload to PyPI

- Make a GitHub release?
- Make sure PyPI links & other instructions in the docs work

Later:
- Add TurboCtl to conda-forge
- Add an error message when Urwid is not installed
- Remove unnecessary dev files from the distributed package
- Add an alias to the pump command
- Update the usage pics
- Update tests
- Fix double colons in Sphinx-generated parameter lists.
- Reformat alias lists to match the usage page.
- Make sure the program crashes elegantly when e.g. it cannot connect to the
  pump.
- Add commands to set the setpoint (most important), save data, read errors
  etc.
- Move singledispatchmethod to datatypes.py.
- Run pylint/pycodestyle.
- Make sure there are no TODO tags anywhere is the code.
- Replace custom scrollbar implementation with the new Urwid one

Perhaps at some point:
- Make sure only one user can control the pump at a time
- Improve the parser so that e.g. "list p [1, 2]" is valid syntax.
  The command parser could also be moved into a separate class, so that it
  could be tested more easily. Also, parser.py might be simplified by using
  the parsing modules in the standard library.
- Document the format in parameters.txt better? This might even be turned into
  e.g. a CSV file.
- Document individual enum members in codes.py.
- Rename WrongNumError to NumberError or something?
- Open the output of the info and help commands with less if a specific
  argument is given?
- The docstrings of the read/write_parameter methods say
  "Raises ValueError if number or index have invalid values". Clarify this.
- Add instructions for importing the API/control interface (and also add 
  those to the turboctl namespace)
- Fix the bug where closing TurboCtl in screen doesn't erase the UI text.
