"""String constants used throughout the TurboCtl project.

This module defines a place where string constants such as URLs can be defined
and changed without having to go through multiple files to manually change the
values in each of them.

These constants are used by the :ref:`turboctl` Python module, the Sphinx
documentation, and scripts at the top level of the project, so the module
is defined at the top level with links to it inside both the ``doc`` and
:ref:`turboctl` directories.
The link inside :ref:`turboctl` is a hard link so that this module is included
in the :ref:`turboctl` package when it is installed from PyPI.

Defining the constants only inside :ref:`turboctl` and then importing the
package would create a dependency to :ref:`turboctl` which would complicate
the compilation of documentation with Read the Docs.
:ref:`turboctl` can be added to the dependency list for RtD, but the version
being used would be the one on PyPI, which may be different to the one the
documentation is being written for (which is fetched from GitHub).

Running this module as a script copies the constants to the shell file
``global_constants.sh``, where they can be easily accessed by shell scripts.
