# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.
#
# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full
# list see the documentation:
# http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/config

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
# import os
# import sys
# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))

# The TurboCtl directory should already be in $PATH.

# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------
from datetime import date


project = 'TurboCtl'
author = 'Feliks Kivel√§'
version = 'placeholder'
copyright = 'placeholder'

# Reading turboctl.__version__ directly would create a dependency to turboctl
# which complicates compilation with Read the Docs.
# turboctl can be added to the dependency list for RtD but that is the version
# on PyPI which may be different to the one the docs are being written for
# (which is fetched from GitHub).

# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

# Autodoc: Generate documentation from docstrings automatically.
# Napoleon: Support for Google-style docstrings.
# Intersphinx: Link to the documentaion of other sphinx projects.
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.napoleon',

# Use the class docstring (instead of the __init__ docstring) for class
# descriptions.
# This seems to be the default value, but is specified just in case.
autoclass_content = 'class'

# Document classes, functions etc. in the same order as they are defined in the
# source code, instead of alphabetical order.
autodoc_member_order = 'bysource'

# This allows function signatures to be specified on the first line of the
# docstring.
# This is very useful for preventing sphinx from expanding DEFAULT in
# "func(arg=DEFAULT)".
autodoc_docstring_signature = True

	# a module or an object.

	'special-members': True,
	# Print members in the same order as they as in the source files.

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.

html_theme = 'alabaster'

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
